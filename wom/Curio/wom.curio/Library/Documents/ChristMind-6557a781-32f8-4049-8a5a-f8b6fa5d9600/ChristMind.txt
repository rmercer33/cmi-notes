There is but the Mind of Christ within each of us. A spark of Divine Light that
rests in perfect communion and communication with all of Creation. The one
fundamental energy, the offspring of the Father.

It is all that remains when illusion has been set aside and the Truth
remembered.

>> Summary ~ 10411000.009

Christ is that quiet and that presence that observes all of Creation flowing through
a field of awareness called the Mind of Christ. Unlimited, unchanging, one substance,
one Light, one Truth. Here alone does reality reside, does Love reign. Here is
where you are.

God's creation is one, the Christ Mind. That Mind is not in a body, is not a
particular form and does not belong to any personal entity.

>> Summary ~ 10508000.041

This means that within the One Mind of Christ, if you would perceive it for a
moment as an ocean, individuation occurs; individual waves arise, made of the
same substance — perfect freedom, perfect knowledge of, and union with, God.
And in that freedom, the power to decide or to desire is present. And desire
begets worlds without end.

>> Summary ~ 10603000.061

The Christ Mind recognizes it has no purpose, whatsoever, except to extend
Love.

Christ is concerned only with whether or not that which they consume for
the sake of the body was consumed in Love. For Love is what allows the
transmutation of anything that comes into the physical system and allows it to
be turned to that which supports the energetic wholeness of the physical system
itself.

We abide as the One Mind (of Christ), birthed from the very Heart of Abba, or
God. There is nothing outside of us. And from within, there is nothing hidden.
Though the dimensions of Creation be infinite, they abide within the Mind, or
the Field of Consciousness, that we share as One.

There is only One, that there is only Heaven, that there is only Love, that
there is only the Perfect Peace that passes all understanding.

The soul, or the heart, resides within the Mind of God, within the Mind of
Christ; for these are One and the same.

>> Summary ~ 10609000.036

You are free to be That One who as the Mind of Christ — which, by the way, is
God — shows up in the transfigured body-mind.  Where once there was a false
sense of “I,” now there is only the free, unobstructed Field of Awareness of
God observing Creation through His Creation, God observing His Creation
through His Creation.

>> Summary ~ 10609000.044

It can only be the Christ Mind in you that could perceive the Christ Mind in
Jeshua ben Joseph. And the Christ Mind is the extension of God’s Perfect Being
into, and as, Creation.
