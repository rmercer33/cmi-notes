The present is where God abides. There is no question there is no doubt.
There is no interference of the egoic mind and there is no fear. There
is no time.

The Peace of Christ comes only to that mind that withdraws valuation
from the past and the future, and surrenders into the present. For only in
the present can Love be felt, known, and extended.

The mind that is free from the egoic need to make, to control, to shape,
the mind that is free from identification with the past and anxiety over
the future abides in the perfectly eternal now, the present.
