# The Pathway

A *pathway* is a way taken to reach a destination or a way of
achieving a specified result. It could be a hike to a waterfall in the
mountains or a course of study resulting in a university degree. The
journey along the pathway takes the traveler from the beginning to new
place entirely.

*The Way of the Heart* defines a pathway that is traveled by the mind,
not the body. It is very different from a hike to the waterfall or
obtaining a degree. It begins with a mind in separation and follows a
path of purification and healing that culminates with a mind in union
with everyone and everything.

It is a pathway to Christ Mind, from separation consciousness to unity
consciousness. A stated goal of *The Way of the Heart* is that of ten
million awakened Children of God, fully awake, not just as a belief or
idea, but who have mastered fear and no longer live in doubt.

The pathway is introduced and guided by the authority of one who has
lived it and knows the pitfalls along the way.
